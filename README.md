# EdgeCase Pairing Config

Our collection of dot-files for EdgeCase pairing machines.  Also applicable for individual developer machines.

## Install

Just clone the directory somewhere and run `rake`.  This will symlink the necessary
files to your home directory (asking for permission before clobbering anything).

## What's missing

There are no Vim or Emacs configs in this repo.  For Vim, check out
our [vim-config](http://github.com/edgecase/vim-config) repo.
